description: Free-form Flux AST to prepend to query requests
type: object
properties:
  type:
    type: string
    enum: [File]
    default: File
# NOTE: Purposefully type-less here because the boilerplate produced
# by codegen off the Flux AST spec is unmangeable. The CLI only needs
# to use a small subset of the AST and rarely changes what it sends,
# so we can live with a generic map in the codegen request body.
