# Influx CLI - extra files supporting HTTP client

The `.go` files in this module are generated using [`OpenAPITools/openapi-generator`](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator),
based off of our public API documentation. 

See https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/2360 - enums are not generated by default if they are defined inline.
Even if they were generated by default, there appears to be no way to turn off the validation, which would be bad if the client
started receiving new string values that were unrecognized (using an old client with a newer InfluxDB instance).

So the go files in this directory are generated from some enums where we want to know the list of 'known' valid values, but
we don't want to always validate on marshal/unmarshal.
